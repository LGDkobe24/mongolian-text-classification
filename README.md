# steps

- Run spider in order to collect corpuses and labels from ikon.mn
    > scrapy runspider ikon_mn_scrape.py

- Create word2vec from all files inside 'corpuses' directory
    > python3 clear_create_word2vec.py 

- Convert word2vec file to ids matrix as a numpy file format in order to use with tensorflow
    > python3 numpy_embedding_matrix_tf.py

- Use embedding matrix with tensorflow in eager mode
    > python3 convert_text_to_seqvector_through_embedmatrix.py



# TODOs

1. Write some scrapers for ikon.mn
2. Prepare training texts with its labels, label should be a type of news. For example: politics, economy, society, health, world, technology etc
3. Train them
4. Try to classify text from other sites, for example: news.gogo.mn
